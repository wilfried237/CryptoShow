**USER EXPERIENCE: Crypto Show Systems**

**Seminar 1**

**Hardware Platform**

We decided to focus on computer platforms since users will be more likely to access the system through web browsers on desktop or laptop computers, plus our primary clients are cybersecurity experts and computer history buffs. Therefore, it makes sense to choose a desktop/laptop computer for the hardware platform. 

**System Functionality**

- User registration and login
- Exhibit registration
- Exhibit management
- Device tracking
- Narrative planning
- Attendee Registration
- Attendee check-in
- Informative content displays

**User Stories**

- As a society member, I want to easily register and log in to the CryptoShow system.
- As an exhibitor, I want to register my exhibit and list the devices I will bring.
- As a visitor, I want to view informative content about exhibits during the show.
- As an attendee, I want to register for the show and indicate my interests.
- As an attendee, I want a smooth check-in process upon arrival at the show.
- As an organiser, I want to manage exhibits, including time and location.
- As an organiser, I want to track the devices each exhibitor plans to bring.
- As an organiser, I want to plan narratives around exhibits to engage non-hobbyist visitors

**System Functions**

- User authentication and registration system
- Exhibit registration and management tools
- Device tracking and inventory management system
- Narrative planning and content management system
- Attendee registration and check-in system
- Informative content display features







**Use Case Diagram and System Functions**

The use case diagram illustrates the interactions between users and the CryptoShow system, outlining key functionalities necessary to support the tasks and goals of both exhibitors, Attendee  and organisers. Each system function corresponds to specific user actions and requirements identified through user stories.







**Seminar 2**

**Considered Functionality and Use Cases**

**User Registration and Login**

- Users should be able to register for an account on the platform
- Users can log in with existing credentials
- Registration form can collect essential information such as the username, email and password in order to store for future recall
- Login uses two simple fields: Username/Email and Password in order to gain access
- Users receive an confirmation email to confirm their email address which ensures no spam spam or fake registrations take place

**Password Management**

- Users can reset their passwords via email
- Strong password with at least 8 characters and one special character needed for security



**Exhibit registration**

- Exhibitors can upload their exhibits, and provide details about the exhibit

**Exhibit Management**

- Organisers can manage exhibits, assign locations, time slots, and other logistics

**Device Tracking**

- Organisers can track the devices that each exhibitor plans to bring to the exhibit to help with planning.

**Narrative Planning**

- Organisers can plan narratives about exhibits to engage more visitors

**Attendee Registration**

- Attendees can register and indicate their interest in an exhibit

**Attendee Check-in**

- Attendees can check in when they arrive at the show, allowing for smooth entry

**Informative Content Display**

- Visitors have access to information about exhibits during the exhibit


**Screen Displays and Navigation**

The system should have several main-screen displays:

**Home/Login Screen**

- Allows users to log in or register for an account.
- Information displayed: login/register options, system overview, upcoming events.
- Navigation: Visitors can look through upcoming events, get more information, or go to the registration/login page.

**Exhibit Registration Screen**

- Allows exhibitors to register their exhibits.
- Information displayed: Form fields with a submission button and fields for exhibit details (name, description, devices).
- Navigation: Exhibitors have the option to continue with exhibit registration or return to the main screen.

**Exhibit Management Screen**

- It enables organizers to manage exhibits.
- Information displayed: list of registered exhibits, options to edit/delete exhibits, scheduling tools.
- Navigation: Organisers have the option to return to the main screen or retrieve particular exhibit information for management.

**Attendee Registration Screen**

- Allows attendees to register for the show.
- Information displayed: Form fields for attendee details, interests, and preferences.
- Navigation: Attendees can either navigate back to the home screen or proceed with registration.

**Attendee Check-in Screen**

- enables attendees to check in when they get to the event.
- Information displayed: check-in form, QR code scanner, and confirmation message.
- Navigation: Attendees can either continue with the check-in process or return to the home screen.

**The exhibit Details Screen**

- provides comprehensive details about a particular exhibit.
- Information displayed: exhibit name, description, devices, schedule, and narrative details.
- Navigation: Users have the option to view related exhibits or return to the home screen.

**Information Content Screen**

- During the show, educational content regarding the exhibits is presented
- Information displayed: description, images, videos, related articles.
- Navigation: Visitors have the option to explore more content or return to the home screen.










**Seminar 3**

**Basic Assumptions**

We agreed upon the following basic assumptions about how the CryptoShow system will work:

- The system will be a web based application accessible through web browsers
- Users will need to register to an account to fully access the system
- Exhibitors will be able to register their exhibits after providing key details such as exhibit name, exhibit description, and devices to exhibit
- Organisers will be granted access to management tools, which will grant them permissions to oversee exhibits, plan narratives for exhibit, and schedule events
- Attendees will be able to register for events, and will be able to indicate their interests
- The system will feature information about exhibits so visitors have a better experience throughout the event

**Process of Adding a Description of an Item of Computer Hardware or a Cryptographic Device to a User’s Member Profile**

**Beginning of the Task**

- The user will log into their profile on the cryptoshow system
- The user will go to their profile settings or exhibit management section

**Sequence of User Actions and System Responses**

- The user will select the option to add a new item to their profile
- The system will then load a form with empty fields for the use to enter details about hardware or cryptographic device
- Once the user has filled the form they submit it
- The system will confirm if the submission has been successful and updates the user’s profile with the new item

**Storyboard -Draw Storyboard and add it here**

Draw a storyboard for this process, with illustrations of each of the major screen states, showing what information and controls are displayed. Make sure that the complete interaction sequence is clear.




**Confirming Attendance at an Event and Specifying Items to Bring**

**Beginning of the Task**

- The user will log into their profile on the cryptoshow system
- The user will go to the event details page or to their event registration

**Sequence of User Actions and System Responses**

- The user will select the event they want to attend and show they are attending
- The system will bring up options specifying which items of hardware or software the user will bring to the event
- From the options the user must select the items they are bringing, or add new items
- The system will confirm if the submission has been successful and updates the user’s event registration with the specified item

**Storyboard-Draw Storyboard and add it here**

Draw a storyboard for this process, with illustrations of each of the major screen states, showing what information and controls are displayed. Make sure that the complete interaction sequence is clear.

**Listing Cryptographic Devices Promised for an Event**

**Beginning of the Task**

- The organiser will log into the cryptoshow system
- The organiser goes to the event management or exhibit planning section

**Sequence of User Actions and System Responses**

- The organiser will select specific events that they want to list cryptographic devices to
- The system gets a list of exhibitors registered for the event
- The organiser will select an exhibitor to see the devices they selected they will bring
- The system will show the list of cryptographic devices that the exhibitor selected as items that he will bring
